annote = {Objective of the paper: 
To discuss a transformation of a continuous k-variate distribution F(x{\_}1,...,x{\_}k) into the uniform distribution on the k-dimensional hypercube. 


Key idea: 
Let X = (X{\_}1,...,X{\_}k) be a randon vector with distribution function F(x{\_}1,...,x{\_}k). Let z = (z{\_}1,...,z{\_}k) = Tx = T(x{\_}1,...,x{\_}k), where T is the transformation considered. 

It can be shown that the random vector Z= TX is uniformly distributed on the k-dimensional hypercube. Then Z{\_}1,...,Z{\_}k are uniformly and independently distributed on [0,1].},

Lightly read sections 2, 3, and 4. 





1. A new forecasting method is proposed for forecasting age-specific mortalitiy and fertility rates which is robust, allows for smooth functions of age, and provides a modelling framework that is easily adapted to allow for constraints and other information. The model is a generalization of the Lee-Carter (LC) model. 


2. The methodology can be applied to time series data observed discretely and possibly with error. The methodology is applied to French mortality and Australian fertility data, and the forecasts obtained are shown to be superior to those from the LC method and served of its variants.},

$\backslash$begin{\{}enumerate{\}}
$\backslash$item Section 1: Introduction - introduces the two cultures of statistical modeling
$\backslash$begin{\{}enumerate{\}}
$\backslash$item The data modeling culture / Statistical community
$\backslash$begin{\{}itemize{\}}
$\backslash$item The data mechanism is known i.e. the data are generated by a given stochastic data model.
$\backslash$item Led to irrelevant theory, questionable conclusions. 
$\backslash$item Model validated using goodness--of--fit tests and residual examination. 
$\backslash$item 98$\backslash${\%} of statisticians use this culture. 
$\backslash$end{\{}itemize{\}}
$\backslash$item The algorithmic modeling culture / Algorithmic modeling
$\backslash$begin{\{}itemize{\}}
$\backslash$item The data mechanism is unknown.
$\backslash$item Can be used on large complex data sets.
$\backslash$item Can be used as a more accurate and informative alternative to data modeling on smaller data sets.
$\backslash$item Model validation is measured by predictive accuracy. 
$\backslash$item 2$\backslash${\%} of statisticians use this culture.
$\backslash$end{\{}itemize{\}}
$\backslash$end{\{}enumerate{\}}


$\backslash$item Section 2: Road map
$\backslash$begin{\{}enumerate{\}}
$\backslash$item Main contribution of this section - how the author became a member of the algorithmic modeling culture.
$\backslash$item Data modeling - is used in analyzing data and getting information about the mechanisms producing the data. But there is misuse leading to questionable conclusions about the underlying mechanism. 
$\backslash$end{\{}enumerate{\}}


$\backslash$item Section 3: Projects in consulting 
$\backslash$begin{\{}enumerate{\}}
$\backslash$item Main contribution of this section - Two of the projects the author worked on (with decision trees in the algortihmic modeling culture) as a consultant. 
$\backslash$end{\{}enumerate{\}}


$\backslash$item Section 4: Return to the university 
$\backslash$begin{\{}enumerate{\}}
$\backslash$item Main contribution of this section - All articles begin and end with data models. The author's observations about published theoretical research (using data models) in statistics. 
$\backslash$end{\{}enumerate{\}}


$\backslash$item Section 5: The use of data models
$\backslash$begin{\{}enumerate{\}}
$\backslash$item Main contribution of this section - Misuse leading to questionable conclusions about the underlying mechanism. 
$\backslash$item When a model is fit to data to draw quantitative conclusions, the conclusions are about the model's mechanism, and not about the nature's mechanism. 
$\backslash$item Besides computing {\$}R{\^{}}2{\$}, nothing else was done to see if the observational data could have been generated by the model. 
$\backslash$item Current applied practice is to check the data model fit using goodness--of--fit tests and residual anaysis.
$\backslash$item Goodness--of--fit tests have very little power unless the direction of the alternative is precisely specified. The implication is that omnibus godness--of--fit tests, which test in many directions simultaneously, have little power, and will not reject until the lack of fit is extreme. 
$\backslash$item If variables are deleted or nonlinear combinations of the variables added, then goodness--of--fit tests are not applicable.
$\backslash$item Residual analysis could not uncover the lack of fit in more than four to five dimensions as with higher dimensions, the interactions between the variables can produce passable residual plots for a variety of models. 
$\backslash$item The most obvious way to see how well the data model is: fit the parameters in the model by using the data, then using the model predict the data and see how good the prediction is. Prediction is rarely perfect. There are usually many unmeasured variables whose effect is referred to as {\&}quot;noise{\&}quot;.
$\backslash$item If the model has too many parameters, then it may overfit the data and give a biased estimate of accuracy. To get a more unbiased estimate of predictive accuracy, cross-validation can be used. 
$\backslash$end{\{}enumerate{\}}


$\backslash$item Section 6: The limitations of data models
$\backslash$begin{\{}enumerate{\}}
$\backslash$item Main contribution of this section - How the commitment to data modeling has prevented statisticians from entering new scintific and commercial fields where the data being gathered is nt suitable for analysing by data models. 
$\backslash$end{\{}enumerate{\}}


$\backslash$item Section 7: Algorithmic modeling
$\backslash$begin{\{}enumerate{\}}
$\backslash$item Main contribution of this section - Machine learning
$\backslash$item Two powerful new algorithms for fitting data: neural nets and decision trees. 
$\backslash$item The three of the most important changes in perception: $\backslash$$\backslash$
Rashoman: the multiplicity of good models $\backslash$$\backslash$
Occam: the conflict between simplicity and accuracy $\backslash$$\backslash$
Bellman: dimensionality-curse or blessing? 
$\backslash$end{\{}enumerate{\}}


$\backslash$item Section 8: Rashoman and the multiplicity of good models
$\backslash$begin{\{}enumerate{\}}
$\backslash$item Main contribution of this section - Rashoman effect is that there is often a multitude of different descriptions (equations) in a aclass of functions giving about the same minimum error rate. 
$\backslash$end{\{}enumerate{\}}


$\backslash$item Section 9: Occam and simplicity vs accuracy
$\backslash$begin{\{}enumerate{\}}
$\backslash$item Main contribution of this section - In prediction, accuracy and simplicity (interpretability) are in conflict. 
$\backslash$item Occam dilemma: Accuracy generally requires more complex prediction methods. Simple and interpretable functions do not make the most accurate predictors. 
$\backslash$end{\{}enumerate{\}}


$\backslash$item Section 10: Bellman and the curse of dimensionality
$\backslash$begin{\{}enumerate{\}}
$\backslash$item Main contribution of this section - the curse of dimensionalit. If there were too many prediction variables, the recipe was to find a few features (functions of predictor variables) that contain most of the information. 
$\backslash$end{\{}enumerate{\}}


$\backslash$item Section 11: Information from a black box
$\backslash$begin{\{}enumerate{\}}
$\backslash$item Main contribution of this section - Algorithmic model can produce more and more reliable information about the structure of the relationship between inputs and the outputs than data models.
$\backslash$item Higher predictive accuracy is associated with more reliable information about the underlying data mechanism. Algorithmic models can give better predictive accuracy than data models, and provide better information about the underlying mechanism.
$\backslash$item The goal is not interpretability, but accurate information. 
$\backslash$end{\{}enumerate{\}}


$\backslash$item Section 12: Final remarks
$\backslash$begin{\{}enumerate{\}}
$\backslash$item Main contribution of this section - Move away from exclusive dependence on data models and adopt a more diverse set of tools.
$\backslash$item The goals in statistics: use data to predict and to get information about the underlying data mechanism.

annote = {Objective:
Using density forecast evaluation techniques, we compare the predictive performance of econometric specifications thathave been developed for modeling duration processes in intra-day financial markets. 




What done under density evaluation:
We follow DGT and emphasize visual inspection of autocorrelograms and the histogram implied by the z sequence and the informal nature of the approach.


The autocorrelograms will reveal potential deficiencies of a model to account for the dynamics of the duration process. Serial correlation in the z series may indicate that the mean dynamics have been inadequately modeled by the forecaster. 


To detect nonlinear forms of dependence, one may not only examine the z correlogram but also those of powers of z.


By plotting a histogram based on an empirical z sequence, departures from iid U(0,1) can easily be detected.

This article presents a selective survey of applications of density forecasting and discusses some issues concerning the production, presentation, and evaluation of density.




Evaluation of density:
Statistical evaluations of real-time density forecasts have recently begun to appear, although the key device, the probability integral transform, has a long history.


The literature usually cites Rosenblatt (1952) for the basic result, and the approach features in several expositions from different points of view, such as Dawid (1984) and Cooke (1991).

The following issues were covered in the discussion.
- The AIC is better suited to mode selection for prediction as it is asymptotically equivalent to leave-one-out cross-validation in regression, or one-step cross-validation in time series. On the other hand, it might be argued that the BIC is better suited to model selection for explanation, as it is consistent. $\backslash$$\backslash$
- P-values are associated with explanation, not prediction. It makes little sense to use p-values to determine the variables in a model that is being used for prediction (There are problems in using p-values for variable selection in any context, but that is a different issue). $\backslash$$\backslash$
- Multicollinearity has a very different impact if your goal is prediction from when your goal is estimation. When predicting, multicollinearity is not really a problem provided the values of your predictors lie within the hyper-region of the predictors used when estimating the model. $\backslash$$\backslash$
- An ARIMA model has no explanatory use, but is great at short-term prediction. $\backslash$$\backslash$
- How to handle missing values in regression is different in a predictive context compared to an explanatory context. For example, when building an explanatory model, we could just use all the data for which we have complete observations (assuming there is no systematic nature to the missingness). But when predicting, you need to be able to predict using whatever data you have. So you might have to build several models, with different numbers of predictors, to allow for different variables being missing. $\backslash$$\backslash$
- Many statistics and econometrics textbooks fail to observe these distinctions. In fact, a lot of statisticians and econometricians are trained only in the explanation paradigm, with prediction an afterthought. That is unfortunate as most applied work these days requires predictive modelling, rather than explanatory modelling.},

- `Big Data' is meant to capture the opportunities and challenges facing researches in accessing, managing, analysing and interating data sets of diverse data types. 
- Machine learning are innovative mathematical and statistical models for analysing big data sets. 


Rob's summary of the paper is here below.
- It is a nice introduction to trees, bagging, and forests, plus a very brief entr{\'{e}}e to the LASSO and the elastic net and to slab and spike regression. Not enough to be able to use them, but ok if you have no idea what they are. - It was more disappointing on boosting (completely ignoring the fact that boosting can be applied in a regression context as well as a classification context), and his comments on causality seemed curiously na{\"{\i}}ve. His suggested approach involved forecasting using all variables but the one that is considered causal, and then comparing the results against what actually happened. That seems at least as likely to lead to false conclusions on causality as instrumental variables or differences-in-differences. Although Varian cites Pearl's work approvingly, I doubt that Pearl would return the favour. 
- On a positive note, his Bayesian Structural Time Series model (which I heard him speak about in Rome 12 months ago) seems interesting and very useful. I wonder when the promised R package will appear?},

Let {\{}f{\_}t (y{\_}t |omega{\_} t ){\}}t=1,...,m be the sequence of data generating processes governing a series y{\_}t, where omega{\_}t = {\{}y{\_}{\{}t-1{\}}, y{\_}{\{}t-2{\}}, ... {\}} , and let {\{}p{\_}t(y{\_}t |omega{\_} t){\}}t-1,..,m be a corresponding sequence of 1-step-ahead density forecasts. 


The task of determining whether{\{}p{\_}t(y{\_}t |omega{\_} t){\}}t-1,..,m = {\{}f{\_}t (y{\_}t |omega{\_} t ){\}}t=1,...,m appears difficult, perhaps hopeless, because {\{}f{\_}t (y{\_}t |omega{\_} t ){\}}t=1,...,m is never observed.


Then using probability integral transform is simply the cumulative density function corresponding to the density p{\_}t(y{\_}t) evaluated at y{\_}t,
z{\_}t = int{\_}{\{}-infyt{\}}{\^{}}{\{}y{\_}t{\}} p{\_}t(u) du = P{\_}t(y{\_}t)




Practical Application:
Formal tests are not constructive. If, fox example, a Kolmogoxov-Smixnov test rejects the hypothesis of i.i.d. U(0,l) behavior, is it because of violation of unconditional uniformity, violation of i.i.d., or both? uniformity, violation of i.i.d., or both? 


Moreover, even if we know that rejection comes from violation of uniformity, we would like to know more: What, precisely is the nature of the violation of uniformity? 


Similarly, even if we know that rejection comes from a violation of i.i.d., is z heterogeneous but independent, or is z dependent? 


Hence, they adopt less formal garphical methods which we 'supplement' with more formal tests. First, as regards unconditional uniformity, we suggest visual assessment using a density estimate.


Second, as regards evaluating whether x is i.i.d., we again suggest visual assessment using the obvious graphical tool, the correlogram. The correlogram provides useful information about the deficiencies of density forecasts.},

abstract = {The analysis of integrated and co-integrated time series can be considered as the main methodology employed in applied econometrics. This book not only introduces the reader to this topic but enables him to conduct the various unit root tests and co-integration methods on his own by utilizing the free statistical programming environment R. The book encompasses seasonal unit roots, fractional integration, coping with structural breaks, and multivariate time series models. The book is enriched by numerous programming examples to artificial and real data so that it is ideally suited as an accompanying text book to computer lab classes. The second edition adds a discussion of vector auto-regressive, structural vector auto-regressive, and structural vector error-correction models. To analyze the interactions between the investigated variables, further impulse response function and forecast error variance decompositions are introduced as well as forecasting. The author explains how these model types relate to each other. Bernhard Pfaff studied economics at the universities of G ttingen, Germany; Davis, California; and Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany. He obtained a diploma and a doctorate degree at the economics department of the latter entity where he was employed as a research and teaching assistant. He has worked for many years as economist and quantitative analyst in research departments of financial institutions and he is the author and maintainer of the contributed R packages ``urca'' and ``vars.''},

@article{Mitchell2010a,
abstract = {This paper reviews current density forecast evaluation procedures, and considers a proposal that such procedures be augmented by an assessment of ‘sharpness’. This was motivated by an example in which some standard evaluation procedures using probability integral transforms cannot distinguish the ideal forecast from several competing forecasts. We show that this example has some unrealistic features from a time series forecasting perspective, and so provides insecure foundations for the argument that existing calibration procedures are inadequate in practice. Our alternative, more realistic example shows how relevant statistical methods, including information-based methods, provide the required discrimination between competing forecasts. We introduce a new test of density forecast efficienc},

annote = {NOTE: My research does not involve {\&}quot;smoothing data/observations{\&}quot;, {\&}quot;outliers{\&}quot;, and {\&}quot;robustness{\&}quot;. Here need to pay the attention on finding evenly spaced points which are very closeby inorder to avoid missing any data of the dataset. Then get a matris as M*n where M is the number of points and n is the sample size. (CHECK THIS OUT THIS SECTION!!!)
        

        

        Lightly read sections 2, 3, and 4. 
        

        

        
1. A new forecasting method is proposed for forecasting age-specific mortalitiy and fertility rates which is robust, allows for smooth functions of age, and provides a modelling framework that is easily adapted to allow for constraints and other information.  The model is a generalization of the Lee-Carter (LC) model. 

        
2. The methodology can be applied to time series data observed discretely and possibly with error. The methodology is applied to French mortality and Australian fertility data, and the forecasts obtained are shown to be superior to those from the LC method and served of its variants.
